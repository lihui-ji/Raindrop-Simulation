raindropFoam dynamically calculate the water phase center and move it to the domain center in each time step.

To setup raindropFoam, modify setAll version number and run ./setAll

For raindropFoam_v9 and raindropFoam_v8, the key difference in raindropFoam.C
v9 replaces "fvOptions.H" in v8 with "fvModels.H"

The v8 is not under active maintanence. v8 can only do "pause and continue run" for single drop in domain center initially.

The updates:
1. Solve the bug that the "pause and continue" fails when initial drop center not aligns with first token in setFieldsDict
2. Now caluculate water volume by summing volumes of water cells so it can handle non-uniform mesh
